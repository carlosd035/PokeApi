This project is a simple website that utilizes the PokéAPI to fetch and display information about Pokémon. The site allows users to search for Pokémon by name, navigate to the next or previous Pokémon by ID, and cache requests using useCallback for improved performance.

Features : 
        - Search by Name: Users can enter the name of a Pokémon to retrieve its details.
        - Navigate by ID: Users can move to the next or previous Pokémon using their ID.
        - Request Caching: The site caches API requests using useCallback to enhance performance and reduce redundant requests.
